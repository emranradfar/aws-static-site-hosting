# üåê AWS Static Website Hosting Project

This project demonstrates how to host a simple static website on AWS using the **Free Tier**.

## ‚úÖ What I Used

- **S3** ‚Äì Static website hosting
- **CloudFront** ‚Äì Content Delivery Network (CDN)

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `index.html` ‚Äì Basic HTML site
- `bucketpolicy.json` ‚Äì S3 Bucket Policy
- `screenshots/` ‚Äì S3 & CloudFront setup images
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project overview

## üöÄ Live Flow

1. Created S3 bucket with public access
2. Uploaded HTML file (`index.html`)
3. Enabled static hosting in S3
4. Created CloudFront distribution (HTTPS, CDN)

## üß† Skills Shown

- AWS console navigation
- Static hosting best practices
- CloudFront configuration

This screenshot shows the result of the live static website hosted on AWS, demonstrating that the site is up and running.

## üìÑ S3 Bucket Policy

The **`bucketpolicy.json`** file contains the required policy to grant **public read access** to the objects within the S3 bucket hosting the static website. This policy ensures that visitors can access the website's content via the CloudFront distribution (or directly via the S3 bucket if CloudFront is not used).

Ensure you use your bucket name in the Resource section.

### Here's the content of the policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::emranradfar/*"
  }]
}
